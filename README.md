# royalroad_discord_bot
A webhook bot that will read RSS feeds for fictions on RoyalRoad and notify relevant roles about updates.
First time you run the bot, call the makeFiles function. This will generate the notepad files so if the bot crashes, it will still have saved the last chapter it knows about.

You'll need to edit the dictionaries to put the links and role ID's from discord in them.

To get a role ID on discord, enable Developer Mode in the Appearance menu, then go to the role menu in the server settings, right-click on the role and click "Copy ID".

I will make a UI in the future that makes doing all of this easier than editing the code the first time.
